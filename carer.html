    <h1> Become a Carer </h1>  
    <p>Our goals are the rescue, rehabilitation and release of injured and orphaned native wildlife as well as educating the community about wildlife and habitat preservation. Prospective members must complete a two day weekend, Rescue & Care Course. On successful completion of the course trainees become members of Sydney Wildlife and are issued with an annually renewable authority to rescue and foster care a range of native wildlife including a wide range of native birds, adult possums, turtles and lizards. Once new members have gained some experience, further training is available for those wishing to care for baby animals and/or a range of other species such as bats, snakes, macropods (such as wallabies and kangaroos) and raptors. </p>

    <h1> Whats involved/Rules </h1>  
    <p> Members must be at least 18 years of age and are required to be available for animal rescues when possible and to care for wildlife in their own homes. Members are also expected to meet the costs of travel and animal food and equipment and to commit to working on Sydney Wildlife's Rescue Line. The Rescue Line is operated from our office in Lane Cove National Park from 9am to 5pm 7 days a week. From 5pm to 9am, the After Hours Rescue Line is operated by members from their own home. </p>
